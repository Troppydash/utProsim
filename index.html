            This should be fairly straightforward. Just type in the title of the document you would like to read, click on
            the title and voila. It should take you to the document.

        </p>

        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            It started because of the downfall of another group IB CAS project, The Tartan. The Tartan was a newsletter that
            published about world events. Through a lack of communication and work being done, it was put on hold. But what
            about the articles that were written and never published? Were the hours spent on them lost? This was an issue
            for some people as they wanted their writing out there for people to read (and they didn't want to throw away
            precious CAS hours). So, a few people got together, and Ut Prosim was formed.

            Ut Prosim is a place for writers (and non-writers) to publish their work and to read other's works. On Ut
            Prosim, there is almost limitless possibilities on what you can write. From creative storytelling to informative
            tutorials. From opinion pieces to scientific reports. You can write anything that you can. (Provided it's
            appropriate. meaning not overly violent or erotic)
        </p>
        <p>
            One of Ut Prosim's many upsides is that when you are writing for the purpose of uploading it to Ut Prosim, you
            are uploading it to a platform where many other people will see it. Therefore, making it consider your choices
            and actions, and/ or you could be addressing a global issue within your piece. Thus, making the time taken to
            write and upload count towards your CAS hours. (Could either be Creativity or Service, depending on your topic)
        </p>
        <p>
            When writing your document, we recommend that you put in about 10 hours. This ensures that what you are saying
            is well researched and is your best piece of work.
